# Set:
# 1. Write a program to create an empty set.
# 2. Create a set from a list of elements.
# 3. Write a program, to create new which will contain common elements in two 
# different sets.
# 4. Write a program to get unique items from two sets.
# 5. Update the first set with items that donâ€™t exist in the second set.
# 6. Write a program to return a set of elements present in set a or b, but not both.
# 7. Write a program to check if two sets have any elements in common. If yes, 
# display the common elements.
# 8. Write a program to remove items from set1 that are not common to both set1 
# and set2.
# 9. Write a program to create set of even numbers only.
# 10. Write a program to get size of set.
# 11. Write a program to convert set into tuple and tuple into set.
